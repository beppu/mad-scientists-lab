"Apology," a decade later

According to the Provisional Schedule in the first
English printing of _bolo'bolo_ we should now all be
living happily in _bolos_, traveling around the planet
zwithout credit cards or passports, enjoying hospitality
everywhere, working some, playing some, sleeping some
and not worrying about anything.  Nation-states, armies,
big companies, 9-to-5 jobs, poverty, hunger, car traffic,
environmental pollution, etc., should be no more than dim
memories of a past age of stupidity and mutual fear.  No
such monsters as the USA, Russia or China should exist
any more, but a patchwork of intentional regions (sumi) of
maybe ten million inhabitants and the size of
Pennsylvania largely self-sufficient.  Instead of nations
there should be criss-cross cooperation between these
regions, worldwide.

Now, if we look at the real early '90s, we couldn't be
farther off schedule.  Not only hasn't the Planetary Work
Machine (or economy -- state, private or mixed --  as
some prefer to call it) not dissolved, it's kicking and
alive, killing to the left and to the right, imposing still
lower levels of misery.  We are further away from any
conceivable Utopia than ever.  Instead of paradise, 1991
brought us one of the most cynical wars ever (or shall
we call it a punitive expedition?) to ensure that energy
prices remain "reasonable" and under control.  The Gulf
War has proved once more that the Planetary Work
Machine is really _one_ Machine, not limited by nations,
ideologies or property-systems.  Energy, the blood of the
Machine, is too vital to play funny games.  The divisions
(race, nation, wages, sex) are ours, not the Machine's.

Sure, the three Deals (A,B,C) are still in crisis, and
this crisis has visibly deepened.  In this respect, some of
my predictions of 1983 turned out quite correct.  (You're
always right in predicting bad things, never when doing
the opposite.)  Of course there are more than just three
types of deals between the Machine and us; reality is
infinitely more complex.  Actually, the use of computers
has allowed the Machine to create and manage an "individual"
deal for almost everybody.  So the A,B,C deals
are to be taken as simplified models, roughly corresponding
to the amount of capital invested per worker
("organic composition," as we Marxists sometimes say).

So, a C-deal worker uses thousands of dollars, 10^3, a
B-worker from tens to hundreds of thousands, 10^4-5, a C-
worker, millions, 10^6.  According to their responsibilities
(or risks for the Machine), qualifications, wages, pres-
tige and lifestyle are tuned.  The same holds for political
systems (or procedures of legitimation):  the higher the
organic composition in a given area is, the more
"democracy" and "human rights" you're liable to get.
You're not going to frustrate workers with dictators and
random arrests, if they can ruin equipment worth mil-
lions of dollars by just turning the "wrong" switch in a
fit of "human error"...  (We should keep such business-
like considerations in mind when we talk about lofty
ideals like freedom, democracy, rights and guarantees.)

Talking about deals in crisis, the most striking collapse
in the decade since I first wrote _bolo'bolo_ has occurred in
what I call the B-deal:  the classic industrial-worker deal,
in certain areas managed in the form of socialism.  The
concept of an average organic-composition deal with
"Taylorized" exploitation via relative surplus-value
(productivity linked to worker's performance) seems to
be definitely "out."  Mass workers -- thousands of peo-
ple holding the same jobs and doing comparable chores
-- have proved to be too strong to be submitted to
increasing levels of output.  After having been a low-
wage colony for A-deal regions, Eastern europe became
a liability for the Machine.

_Perestroika_ and other palliative operations of read-
justment couldn't bring the workers back to real work.
So bankruptcy or self-devaluation is the only weapon
left to liquidate a blocked situation.  The new strategy
seems to consist of "special economic zones," a form of
A-deal pockets within "bankrupt" B-deal areas, that
could utilize the accumulated cheap human capital (a
Russian monthly wage corresponds to $12 at the
moment I write this) and infrastructure of socialism.
(This would be similar to the Japanese or Italian models,
where the big companies with their "guaranteed work-
ers" feed on thousands of low-wage sub-contractor
firms.)

The dissolution of the classic B-deal doesn't mean that
industrial production disappears or becomes unimportant.
On the one side, industrial production is robotized and
computerized:  no job is comparable to another, and the link
between physical work and actual output is indirect.  On the
other hand, low technological work (including cleaning,
repairing and maintenance) is geographically or organiza-
tionally separated from end-production and submitted to
conditions similar to what I call the C-deal (largely
female, marginal work).  The B-deal -- of medium-high
organic composition in medium-large production units
paying medium "decent" wages to feed average work-
ing-class families participating in a regular modern
lifestyle -- is being dismantled as well in the West as in
the East.  While it's called Thatcherism or "de-industrial-
ization" in the West and is treated as a purely "econom-
ic" affair, it appears as a real "change of system" in the
East.

It seems that the B-deal will be pulverized between a
few workers joining the A-deal and many more falling
back to the manifold miseries of old and new C-deals.  In
the meantime B-workers are still there, fighting in many
forms, from Brazil to South Korea, from Poland to
China.

The current melt-down of socialism is analogous in
many ways to the Chernobyl accident of 1986.  The reac-
tor got essentially out of control, because it was deprived
of its cooling system.  the crew was playing frustrated
macho-games and tried to run the reactor much below
security levels, in the same way you violate speed limits
in a sports car.  In the same fashion, the socialist factory-
state had no extra cooling system, economy and politics
being in the same basket.  Any economic failure became
another blow to political legitimation, which in turn was
completely worn out by the mid-eighties.  Unlike in the
West -- where you can blame, alternately, politicians _or_
the economy if there is a recession or there isn't enough
money for social programs -- all evils concentrated on
the one and same elite until the social reactor got out of
control.  Seemingly solid states like East Germany, with
a very effective police apparatus, disintegrated miracu-
lously over night.  The collapse of the regimes didn't
mean a collapse of the Machine anywhere though, just a
change of the type of mangement, a psychologically
more refined way of running it.  The one thing we can
learn from this experience is, however, that if we are
capable of undermining ("_substructing_") the Machine 
thoroughly in one place, we don't have to worry too
much about police or military repression.  The experi-
ences of Eastern Europe show that the concept of armed 
revolutionary struggle is out-dated, ridiculous and
unnecessary, at least in industrially advanced areas.
Social mass sabotage is much more effective.

At least as spectacular as the collapse of the B-deal is
the failure of any attempts to create "development" for
the areas I summed up under the C-deal (the planet's
South).  In most parts of Africa, average incomes went
down during the eighties.  Via IMF policies, repression
and starvation became more brutal everywhere.  A new
wave of epidemics like cholera and AIDS was made pos-
sible by a complete neglect of medical and social infra-
structures.  The ultimate collapse of the illusions of
development has spurred ever more desperate flows of
emigration towards Europe or within the South.  The
attack on the remaining possibilities of subsistence
farming has been engineered with droughts, civil war
and deportations.  A "New Enclosure" of formerly com-
munal land is under way, driving farmers into cities and
converting good lands into plantations for cash crops
(exportation).  In some regions the refusal of the C-deal
has grown into mass movements for the refusal of all
deals of "Western Civilization" as a whole.  Some of
these movements try to use ideological expressions of
former stages of the (patriarchal) Machine, and link
themselves to "Islamic fundamentalism."  It is apparent
though, that these movements really care little about
Islam, and that they're social and not religious move-
ments.  Islam just stands for the concept of "cultural
identity" ("nima?") that must still be found autonomous-
ly by the movement.  What we see is just a religiously-
styled elite (mostly trained in U.S. universities) trying to
transform the fundamental refusal into a source of ener-
gy for an "Islamic state" or a phantasmatic "Islamic
economy."  Iran is already in a final stage of this kind of
manipulation, and there are now the first "Islamic fun-
damentalist revolts" against the Islamic state of the aya-
tollahs...  The ferocity of the U.S. attack against
Saddam Hussein can be explained by the fact, that he
(undeservedly, of course) had become the champion
of "fundamentalist" refusals of all deals, from
Indonesia to Morocco and even Trinidad.  The Gulf
War was the first war waged explicitly against all
those who refuse deals... including the A-deal.  And
now there are others...
