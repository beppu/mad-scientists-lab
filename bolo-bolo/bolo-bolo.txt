"Apology," a decade later

According to the Provisional Schedule in the first
English printing of bolo'bolo we should now all be
living happily in bolos, traveling around the planet
zwithout credit cards or passports, enjoying hospitality
everywhere, working some, playing some, sleeping some
and not worrying about anything.  Nation-states, armies,
big companies, 9-to-5 jobs, poverty, hunger, car traffic,
environmental pollution, etc., should be no more than dim
memories of a past age of stupidity and mutual fear.  No
such monsters as the USA, Russia or China should exist
any more, but a patchwork of intentional regions (sumi) of
maybe ten million inhabitants and the size of
Pennsylvania largely self-sufficient.  Instead of nations
there should be criss-cross cooperation between these
regions, worldwide.

Now, if we look at the real early '90s, we couldn't be
farther off schedule.  Not only hasn't the Planetary Work
Machine (or economy -- state, private or mixed --  as
some prefer to call it) not dissolved, it's kicking and
alive, killing to the left and to the right, imposing still
lower levels of misery.  We are further away from any
conceivable Utopia than ever.  Instead of paradise, 1991
brought us one of the most cynical wars ever (or shall
we call it a punitive expedition?) to ensure that energy
prices remain "reasonable" and under control.  The Gulf
War has proved once more that the Planetary Work
Machine is really _one_ Machine, not limited by nations,
ideologies or property-systems.  Energy, the blood of the
Machine, is too vital to play funny games.  The divisions
(race, nation, wages, sex) are ours, not the Machine's.

Sure, the three Deals (A,B,C) are still in crisis, and
this crisis has visibly deepened.  In this respect, some of
my predictions of 1983 turned out quite correct.  (You're
always right in predicting bad things, never when doing
the opposite.)  Of course there are more than just three
types of deals between the Machine and us; reality is
infinitely more complex.  Actually, the use of computers
has allowed the Machine to create and manage an "individual"
deal for almost everybody.  So the A,B,C deals
are to be taken as simplified models, roughly corresponding
to the amount of capital invested per worker
("organic composition," as we Marxists sometimes say).

So, a C-deal worker uses thousands of dollars, 10^3, a
B-worker from tens to hundreds of thousands, 10^4-5, a C-
worker, millions, 10^6.  According to their responsibilities
(or risks for the Machine), qualifications, wages, pres-
tige and lifestyle are tuned.  The same holds for political
systems (or procedures of legitimation):  the higher the
organic composition in a given area is, the more
"democracy" and "human rights" you're liable to get.
You're not going to frustrate workers with dictators and
random arrests, if they can ruin equipment worth mil-
lions of dollars by just turning the "wrong" switch in a
fit of "human error"...  (We should keep such business-
like considerations in mind when we talk about lofty
ideals like freedom, democracy, rights and guarantees.)

Talking about deals in crisis, the most striking collapse
in the decade since I first wrote bolo'bolo has occurred in
what I call the B-deal:  the classic industrial-worker deal,
in certain areas managed in the form of socialism.  The
concept of an average organic-composition deal with
"Taylorized" exploitation via relative surplus-value
(productivity linked to worker's performance) seems to
be definitely "out."  Mass workers -- thousands of peo-
ple holding the same jobs and doing comparable chores
-- have proved to be too strong to be submitted to
increasing levels of output.  After having been a low-
wage colony for A-deal regions, Eastern europe became
a liability for the Machine.
