# Research

These strategies are for doing market or indicator research and are not
intended to be used for real trading. Many of them won't even emit orders.  A
lot of them console.log their findings.

Initially, I was going to do this kind of work in a Debug strategy that I
didn't check in, but there's value in the research I want to do, and I don't
want to throw that code away. Thus, I made a research/ directory to be a home
for these kinds of strategies that help me learn about the market and my own
strategy execution system.  There's a lot to explore here.
