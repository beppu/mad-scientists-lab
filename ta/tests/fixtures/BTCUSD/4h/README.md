These are 4h candles that start at 1612612800000 (which is 2021-02-06 4:00 PST).
They exist for testing indicators/heikinAshi.js.
There are only 23 candles in this file for now.
I wanted recent data to make it easy to compare against TradingView's data.
Also, I believe TradingView holds on to 4h and greater candles for a long time.
If I need to check back in the future, these candles should still be around in TradingView.
