## Bias Detection

Is the overall trend bullish or bearish?  There are various criteria I could use for answering that question.

* Are we above or below the 1d 200 SMA?  (Perhaps other moving averages could be used here as well.)
* Have we made higher lows or lower highs?  (I have a bband-based approach for doing peak and valley detection that I use for divergence that could also be used here.)

The purpose of having a bias is to inform the strategy to change modes.  For example, in a bullish market,
bullish setups tend to work well.  However, once a market turns bearish, their effectiveness tends to be diminished.
A strategy could use bias as a hint to fine tune its actions and adapt to changing market conditions.

Trending vs consolidating could be another kind of bias.
