Once I open a position, I want to have reusable microstrategies for exiting a position in an orderly manner.
That's one kind of code that could live here.

I may want to have different ways to buy in here.
One way is to market buy immediately.
One way is to put in a limit buy and once it's filled, set stops and take profits.
