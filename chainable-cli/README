Chained "method calls" on the command line

Examples:

  env PATH=".:$PATH"    ./chain    .move .resize
  env PATH=".:$PATH"    ./chain -v .move .resize
  env PATH=".:$PATH"    ./chain -v .move .resize --width=80 --height=25
                        ^       ^  ^     ^       ^-- params for chain-resize
                        |       |  |     `---------- call chain-resize
                        |       |  `---------------- call chain-move
                        |       `------------------- global params for all
                        `--------------------------- dispatch script


Limitation:

  You can't have an argument that matches /^\.\w+/, because
  that pattern is used to identify methods.  Maybe some kind
  of escape mechanism can be added to get around this.
