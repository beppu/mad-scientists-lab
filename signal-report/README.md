# Signal Report

This is a quick hack to publish the signals generated by a trading algo to the web
in human readable form.  It's not quite real time, but it's close enough for
debugging.  The page will auto-refresh every 30s.

## Usage

```sh
# Set the log to publish in an environment variable first
export TA_SIGNAL_DEMO=/mad2/ta/log/activity.log
micro-dev -p 5001

```
